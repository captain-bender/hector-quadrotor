Hector Quadrotor Initial Takeoff Drift in ROS Gazebo Simulation

The phenomenon you describe—where a Hector quadrotor drifts laterally during its first takeoff but behaves normally on subsequent flights—is a well-documented characteristic of the Hector quadrotor simulation that stems from several interrelated factors involving controller initialization, sensor stabilization, and the inherent limitations of the velocity-based control system. This behavior represents a combination of numerical instabilities in the physics engine, sensor initialization delays, and the fundamental design philosophy of the Hector quadrotor's control architecture.
Controller Architecture and Drift Characteristics
Velocity-Based Control System Design

The Hector quadrotor simulation employs a fundamentally different control approach than many users expect. The hector_quadrotor_simple_controller plugin implements a velocity controller rather than a position controller, which has significant implications for flight behavior
. This controller operates by applying forces and torques to the simulated vehicle based on velocity commands, rather than directly controlling absolute position. Johannes Meyer, the original developer, explicitly states that "the hector_quadrotor_simple_controller plugin that controls the simulated quadrotor is currently not intended to control the absolute position of the vehicle"

.

This design choice means that drift is not merely an undesirable side effect but an inherent characteristic of the system. The controller adds "more or less realistic forces and torques to the vehicle" to achieve velocity control, which naturally leads to position drift over time
. Most real quadrotors exhibit similar behavior because precise velocity and position observation is challenging, particularly in indoor environments where GPS is unavailable

.
Numerical Instabilities in Physics Simulation

The drift phenomenon you observe is fundamentally rooted in numerical inaccuracies within Gazebo's physics engine. Even when using noise-free ground-truth information for control and in the absence of external disturbances like wind, the quadrotor will drift slowly due to these computational limitations

. The physics engine's discrete time integration and floating-point arithmetic introduce small errors that accumulate over time, causing the apparent drift behavior.

The intensity of this drift can vary depending on the physics engine configuration, solver settings, and update rates. These numerical instabilities are particularly pronounced during the initial startup phase when various system components are still stabilizing

.
Initialization and Sensor Stabilization Effects
Sensor and State Estimation Initialization

The distinctive pattern where the first takeoff exhibits drift while subsequent takeoffs behave normally points to initialization-related issues within the simulation environment. The Hector quadrotor controller subscribes to multiple sensor topics including ground truth state information from the gazebo_ros_p3d plugin and IMU data from the hector_gazebo_ros_imu plugin

. During the initial startup phase, these sensors may not immediately publish stable data, leading to transient control instabilities.

One user specifically noted that "the first seven seconds of the position data also have some interesting dynamics, which I assume are because the odom messages have not yet been published"

. This observation directly correlates with your experience of first-takeoff drift, suggesting that the odometry and state estimation systems require time to stabilize and begin publishing reliable data.
Ground Truth State Topic Dependencies

By default, the Hector quadrotor controller subscribes to the /ground_truth/state topic published by the gazebo_ros_p3d plugin for position and velocity information

. During simulation startup, there may be a brief period where this ground truth information is not yet available or is experiencing initialization transients. The controller's behavior during this period can lead to the lateral drift you observe on the first takeoff.

The hector_quadrotor_gazebo_plugins documentation indicates that if appropriate parameters are set in the URDF file, the controller will use sensor data rather than true state variables from Gazebo

. However, the default configuration relies on ground truth information, which may explain why subsequent takeoffs behave normally once all systems have properly initialized.
Physics Engine and Model Configuration Factors
Inertia and Mass Distribution Effects

Incorrect inertia specifications in the quadrotor model can contribute to drift behavior, particularly during dynamic maneuvers like takeoff. Research has shown that "tilted inertia" caused by improper mass distribution or incorrect inertia tensor calculations can lead to unexpected drift patterns
. In one documented case, a user found that "the drift problem went away after I fixed one of the inertia terms" and noted that even inertia errors in parent links can affect child joint behavior

.

The Hector quadrotor's URDF model includes carefully calculated inertia values, but any discrepancies between the simulated inertia and the expected physical properties can manifest as drift, particularly during the initial takeoff when the vehicle is transitioning from a stationary state to active flight

.
Controller Parameter Optimization

The behavior you observe may also relate to controller gain settings and their interaction with the initialization process. The hector_quadrotor_simple_controller allows modification of control parameters that affect the dynamics of the system

. During the first takeoff, if these parameters are not optimally tuned for the transition from ground contact to free flight, temporary instabilities can occur.

Users have reported that adjusting controller parameters and ensuring proper sensor calibration can minimize these initialization-related drift issues. The fact that subsequent takeoffs behave normally suggests that once the control system has adapted to the flight dynamics and sensor inputs have stabilized, the system operates within expected parameters.
Alternative Solutions and Mitigation Strategies
Position Controller Implementation

For applications requiring precise position control, implementing a cascade position controller on top of the existing velocity controller can significantly reduce drift effects

. This approach involves creating an outer position control loop that generates velocity commands for the existing hector_quadrotor_simple_controller, effectively converting the system from pure velocity control to position control.

Several users in the robotics community have developed custom position controllers that subscribe to the vehicle's state information and publish appropriate velocity commands to the /cmd_vel topic

. These implementations can provide the position-holding behavior that many users expect from a quadrotor simulation.
Sensor Configuration Modifications

The controller's reliance on specific sensor topics can be modified to potentially improve initialization behavior. The documentation suggests that users can "try to delete these two parameters and see if that changes anything" referring to the ground truth state and IMU topic subscriptions

. By modifying which sensors the controller uses for feedback, it may be possible to achieve more consistent behavior across all takeoffs.

Alternative sensor configurations might include using different IMU topics or modifying the state estimation source, though such changes require careful consideration of their impact on overall system stability and performance

.
Conclusion

The lateral drift during initial takeoff followed by normal behavior on subsequent flights represents the interaction of several factors inherent to the Hector quadrotor simulation architecture. The velocity-based control system, sensor initialization delays, and numerical instabilities in the physics engine combine to create this characteristic behavior pattern. While this drift may seem problematic, it reflects realistic quadrotor behavior where position holding requires active control and sensor feedback.

Understanding that this behavior is expected rather than erroneous can help in developing appropriate control strategies and setting realistic expectations for simulation performance. For applications requiring precise position control, implementing additional control layers or modifying sensor configurations can provide improved performance, though these modifications should be carefully evaluated to ensure they align with the intended use case and maintain realistic flight dynamics.
